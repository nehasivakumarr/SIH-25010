## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
  A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory. • Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance. • Weather-based alerts and predictive insights. • Pest/disease detection via image uploads. • Market price tracking. • Voice support for low-literate users. • Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers • Agricultural extension officers • Government agriculture departments • NGOs and cooperatives • Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022). • Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION

1.The app will have an AI assistant.It will connect farmers from all over India and even other countries.This app will available in many languages.

2.Farmers can choose the crops they want to grow by selecting the images of the crops.They can upload photos to the app for disease and pest detection.

3.This app will also tell farmers what fertilizers they need and give advice about soil health.

4.It will provide real-time weather updates and market prices.

5.To check the soil type,farmers will install a sensor which will be super affordable.The sensor will mneasure the soil's temperature,moisture,pH,nutrients and more,and send these data to the app.

6.Farmers can ask questions to the AI assistant by speaking in their own language.They can also interact with other farmers as group discussions.If the farmers who they interact with speaks other language,the app will translate messages.

7.When the farmer selects a crop,the app will auto generate the steps when to sow,fertilize, or water the crops.It will send these messages through voice like notifications.Its like a remainder.

8.This app is mainly for farmers,but agricultural officers,local agritech startups,NGOs and government groups can also use it.

HOW IT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM

The app helps farmers by giving easy advice in their language using AI.It spots crop diseases early and suggestes the right idea with the help of sensors.Farmers get weather and price updates to plan better.This makes farming easier and more successful.

INNOVATION AND UNIQUENESS OF THE SOLUTION

1.Installation of sensor.
2.Pest and disease detection through images.
3.Communicating with other farmers and translating it.
5.Remainders through voice notification.
4.Knowing the market prices.


## Technical Approach

TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED

1.Python for AI and backend development
2.Java for Android and Swift for iPhone,Flutter for both
3.TensorFlow for AI to check plant health
4.OpenCV to understand the image
5.Firebase to store data

## Feasibility and Viability
FEASIBILITY

1.It combines affordable technologies like sensors,images with higher accessibility(multi lingual support and voice assistant)

2.This app offers complete value not by just identifying problems,but also by giving real time informations and market prices and automated crop care.

CHALLENGES AND RISKS

1.The features of the app may not work due to poor internet in remote areas.
2.It's difficult for the AI to  understand the language especially local languages and farming words used by the farmers.
3.If photos are inaccurate or the if the AI cannot able to understand the assignment it may be lead to crop loss.
 
STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES

1.Making the app to work offline by processing the data given initially.
2.We can give an in-built filter for clearer images
3.For language barrier,we can implement  multi-steps where the farmer's voice is converted to text,then the text is translated and given to AI.


## Impact and Benefits
IMPACTS 

1.The main impact is increase in income through early and accurate detection of disease.
2.They gain more knowledge through this.

BENEFITS 

1.Some of the soil pollutions will be controlled through proper use of fertilizers.
2.The yield will be toxic-free and there will be higher yields.
3.There will be higher income for the farmers.
